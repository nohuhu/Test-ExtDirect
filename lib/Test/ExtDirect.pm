    # for a good reason: starting with version 3.0, it is possible to
    # define a method with no strict argument checking, which defaults to
    # using named parameters. To avoid possible problems stemming from this
    # change, we strictly check the existence of arguments for both ordered
    # and named conventions in RPC::ExtDirect::Client.
    #
    # Having said that, I don't think that this kind of strict checking is
    # beneficial for Test::ExtDirect since the test code that calls
    # Ext.Direct methods is probably focusing on other aspects than strict
    # argument checking that happens in the transport layer.

    # As a side benefit, we also get an early warning if something went awry
    # and we can't even get a reference to the Action or Method in question.

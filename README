Test::ExtDirect
===============

    This module provides a set of utility functions for testing Ext.Direct
    classes. For each test script, an instance of RPC::ExtDirect::Server
    will be created, and requests will be made with RPC::ExtDirect::Client.

    This way you can simulate actual Ext JS or Sencha Touch client code
    making calls, submitting forms, uploading files, or polling events - all
    without having to set up a browser testing environment.

    This kind of testing provides additional layer of insurance against
    Ext.Direct specific problems and errors that may otherwise creep into
    the codebase over time.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

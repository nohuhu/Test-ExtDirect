Test-ExtDirect
==============

This module provides a set of utility functions for testing Ext.Direct
classes. For each test script, an instance of RPC::ExtDirect::Server
will be created, and requests will be made with RPC::ExtDirect::Client.

This way you can simulate actual Ext JS or Sencha Touch client code making
calls, submitting forms, uploading files, or polling events. Such testing
provides additional layer of insurance against Ext.Direct specific problems
and errors that may otherwise creep into the codebase.
